Since its incpetion in 2005, DrugBank has been frequently used by pharmaceutical companies, medicinal chemists, students and the general public. In this project, we will be performing a temporal analysis of DrugBank. That is, we will observe how the DrugBank database has evolved over time as this will implicitly give us a bird's eye view on the progress of the field of drug discovery as a whole as well as any trends that may have emerged. We will be exploring the dataset of this project via data visualization packages such as *ggplot* and *ggvis*.\n",

The dataset consists of information on thousands of drugs including their commercial names, indications (i.e. diseases/symptoms they are intended to treat), targets, drug manufacturers and so on.\n",

Specifically, we will be using the *dplyr* and *ggplot* packages as well as the pipe operator, %>%. We also make use of the *ggvis* and *???* packages to produce some interactive visualizations."

These drug cards are regularly curated by experts who ensure that the data inserted into DrugBank is accurate and up-to-date.
